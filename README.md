# react movie list 📽️

This repository contains the files for one of my first React projects, it is a simple watchlist where you can add and track the movies you would like to watch or that you've already watched.

## What I used 🔨
The goal with this project was to build an app to practice using React and the use of an API. The API comes from TMDB.

## Extra learning ✔
This project also taught me how to deploy a React app using gh-pages instead of Heroku or Netlify. Also, I got to learn more about Context API and React Hooks.

## Responsiveness 📱
This project is responsive on any devices.
